1. Q Learning is a program that finds the best action possible based on the current state. The Q stands for quality, or how useful a current action is based on desired results.
2. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that trains software to make decisions to achieve the best/most quality (optimal) results.
For Q Learning to be model-free, it means that a value is associated with actions rather than the formation of internal models.
Q Learning is usually used to improve a model over time so it can learn by making it take the correct action. It's been successfully applied to disciplines like game playing, robotics, and self-driving models.
